## List of SEO Tasks Undertaken So Far

### Google Console
A number of pages from the ShopProp website were not getting indexed, and they were being counted as only one page — the home page.  
To ensure that we see the traffic generated by all the other pages of the website, we built landing pages for all the pages not getting indexed by Google (and made sure that these landing pages redirect users to the original website).

We are now able to see the traffic generated and user visits to all these pages.

### Google Trends
To make sure that we trend in the right places and pop up in the right search feeds, we used **Google Trends** to look up the best-suited keywords for the ShopProp site.  
We integrated them into our website so that the website and various pages appear in our target users’ feeds.
